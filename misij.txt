Hi gabi! Happy 17th birthday to you! yeyyy!. I know we're not together today, and it is sad to think that I won't be able to come. But today is a special day hindi dapat tayo sad okay? Even though I'm not with you to celebrate your birthday, I want you to remember that I will always be here for you, hindi hadlang ang distanya natin sa isa't-isa para sabihin na malayo ako sayo, I am here, inside you're heart, unconditionally loving you forever, because you are so special to me, really. You bring so much joy and love into my life, and I can't imagine my life without you. Thank you for always being there for me, for your kindness, your laughter, and your love. I feel so blessed to have you by my side. I am hoping na sana next year kasama mo na ako, we'll going to celebrate your birthday na together! I am so proud and happy for you, love. With all my heart I wish you have a wonderful day be filled with joy and happiness, may your birthday be as special as you are. I love you.
